                    <li class="li-career-projects"><strong>Ph.D., (Thin Film Technology) - </strong>The public's awareness of the energy crisis has prompted a quest for alternative energy sources, especially those that are green and environmentally sustainable. Photovoltaic is a promising renewable energy technology that converts sunlight to electricity, with broad potential to solve the future energy problem that humanity faces significantly. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are considered a promising renewable source of non-polluting energy because of their low-cost manufacturing process and high-power conversion efficiency. In the DSSC system, the nanocrystalline TiO2 is a vital semiconductor material available for dye adsorption and effective electron transport. 
                        Doped TiO2 nanocrystalline materials (nanoparticles/ films) have been seriously examined over the past decade, and it was found that characteristics of a dye-sensitized solar cell fabricated with doped TiO2 were strikingly better than those with undoped TiO2. The DSSCs that contained the undoped TiO2, Zn and Cu TiO2 nanoparticles photoanodes exhibited efficiencies of 2.55%, 3.66%, and 3.21%, respectively. Thus, the conversion efficiency of the DSSCs fabricated with the Zn containing photoanodes samples exhibited increasing Jsc values from 1.16 to 1.97 mA/cm2 and Voc values from 0.76 to 0.68 V while doping of Zn. The prepared Zn doped TiO2 nanoparticles and the formation of DSSC cell exhibit higher power conversion efficiency (3.66 %).

                    <li class="li-career-projects"><strong>M.Phil., (Thin Film Technology) - </strong>The technology of Thin Film deposition has advanced dramatically during the past 30 years. This advancement was driven primarily by the need for new products and devices in the electronics and optical industries. <strong>“EFFECT OF SEED LAYER ON THE STRUCTURAL AND OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF ZnO NANORODS” </strong> the present experiments showed that the seed layer would influence structure and optical properties of the prepared ZnO nanorods.

                     <li class="li-career-projects"><strong>M.Sc., (Electronics & Communication) -</strong>I developed <strong> “EMBEDDED BASED BANK SECURITY SYSTEM” </strong>for our college which has highly appreciated by the faculty and management. This project was designed on the latest Embedded Technology with minimal functional support of Software and Hardware. Primary objective of this project were to make the fully secured bank and other secured places, easily identify the theft.
